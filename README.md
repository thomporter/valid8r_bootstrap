# Valid8r for Twitter Bootstrap 

*A Plugin for [valid8r_js](https://github.com/thomporter/valid8r_js)*

Valid8r is a validation library for multiple programming languages using a common
JSON configuration file. Learn more about Valid8r and the configuration file
at:

# The Plan

The idea here is to create 2 modules (one for Bootstrap 2 and one for Bootstrap 3)
that will depend on the valid8r_js module. You will interact directly with it, 
instead of valid8r_js.  

Using configuration, with sensible defaults, this plugin will automatically take
care of adding/removing the errors returned by Valid8r for you.
